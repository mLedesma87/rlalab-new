				"abstractText": "Resveratrol is a polyphenol with multiple applications in pharma, cosmetics and food. The aim of this study was to construct Yarrowia lipolytica strains able to produce resveratrol. For this purpose, resveratrol-biosynthesis genes from bacteria and plants were expressed in this host. Since resveratrol can be produced either via tyrosine or phenylaniline, both pathways were tested, first with a single copy and then with two copies. The phenylalanine pathway resulted in slightly higher production in glucose media, although when the media was supplemented with amino acids, the best production was found in the strain with two copies of the tyrosine pathway, which reached 0.085&nbsp;​g/L. When glucose was replaced by glycerol, a preferred substrate for bioproduction, the best results, 0.104&nbsp;​g/L, were obtained in a strain combining the expression of the two synthesis pathways. Finally, the best producer strain was tested in bioreactor conditions where a production of 0.43&nbsp;​g/L was reached. This study suggests that Y.&nbsp;lipolytica is a promising host for resveratrol production from glycerol.",

However, while the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has very high homologous recombination (HR) efficiency, non-homologous end-joining is dominant in Y.&nbsp;lipolytica, and foreign genes are randomly inserted into the genome. Consequently, the low HR efficiency greatly restricts the genetic engineering of this yeast. In this study, RAD52, the key component of the HR machinery in S.&nbsp;cerevisiae, was grafted into Y.&nbsp;lipolytica to improve HR efficiency. The gene ade2, whose deletion can result in a brown colony phenotype, was used as the reporter gene for evaluating the HR efficiency. The HR efficiency of Y.&nbsp;lipolytica strains before and after integrating the ScRad52 gene was compared using insets with homology arms of different length. The results showed that the strategy could achieve gene targeting efficiencies of up to 95% with a homology arm length of 1000 bp, which was 6.5 times of the wildtype strain and 1.6 times of the traditionally used ku70 disruption strategy. This study will facilitate the further genetic engineering of Y.&nbsp;lipolytica to make it a more efficient cell factory for the production of value-added compounds.",

In this review, strategies for engineering four different functional cellular modules which encompass the total process of biomanufacturing are discussed, including expanding the substrate spectrum for substrate uptake modules, refactoring biosynthetic pathways and dynamic regulation for product synthesis modules, balancing energy and redox modules, and cell membrane and cell wall engineering of product storage and secretion modules. Novel strategies of integrating and coordinating different cellular modules aided by synthetic co-culturing of multiple chassis, artificial intelligence&ndash;aided data mining for guiding strain development, and the process for designing automatic chassis development via biofoundry are expected to generate next generations of model microorganism chassis for more efficient biomanufacturing.",

Oleaginous yeasts provide a particularly attractive platform for the sustainable production of biofuels and industrial chemicals due to their ability to accumulate high amounts of lipids. In particular, microbial lipids in the form of triacylglycerides (TAGs) produced from renewable feedstocks have attracted considerable attention because they can be directly used in the production of biodiesel and oleochemicals analogous to petrochemicals. As an oleaginous yeast that is generally regarded as safe, Yarrowia lipolytica has been extensively studied, with large amounts of data on its lipid metabolism, genetic tools, and genome sequencing and annotation.

				"abstractText": "Bacillus subtilis is a preferred microbial host for the industrial production of nutraceuticals and a promising candidate for the synthesis of functional sugars, such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Previously, a GlcNAc-overproducer Bacillus subtilis SFMI was constructed using glmS ribozyme dual regulatory tool. Herein, we further engineered to enhance carbon flux from glucose towards GlcNAc synthesis. As a result, the increased flux towards GlcNAc synthesis triggered phosphosugar stress response, which caused abnormal cell growth. Unfortunately, the mechanism of phosphosugar stress response had not been elucidated in B. subtilis. In order to reveal stress mechanism and overcome its negative effect in bioproduction, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis. The results indicate that cells slow glucose utilization by repression of glucose import and accelerate catabolic reactions of phosphosugar. To verify these results, we overexpressed the phosphatase YwpJ, which relieved phosphosugar stress and allowed us to identify the enzyme responsible for GlcNAc synthesis from GlcNAc6P. In addition, the deletion of nagBB and murQ, responsible for GlcNAc precursor degradation, further improved GlcNAc synthesis. The best engineered strain, B. subtilis FMIP34, increased GlcNAc titer from 11.5 to 26.1 g/L in shake flasks and produced 87.5 g/L GlcNAc in 30-L fed-batch bioreactor. Our results not only elucidate, for the first time, the phosphosugar stress response mechanism in B. subtilis, but also demonstrate how the combination of rational metabolic engineering with novel insights into physiology and metabolism allows the construction of highly efficient microbial cell factories for the production of high value chemicals.

The designed logic gate-based circuits were enabled by the characterization of a new antisense transcription mechanism in B. subtilis.

Functional membrane microdomains (FMMs) in bacteria can provide a platform for enzyme clustering. However, the amount of FMMs at the cell basal level is still facing great challenges in multi-enzyme immobilization. Here, using the nutraceutical N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) synthesis in Bacillus subtilis as a model, we engineered FMM components to improve the enzyme assembly in FMMs. First, by overexpression of the SPFH (stomatin-prohibitin-flotillin-HflC/K) domain and YisP protein, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of squalene-derived polyisoprenoid, the membrane order of cells was increased, as verified using di-4-ANEPPDHQ staining. Then, two heterologous enzymes, GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) and haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatases (YqaB), required for GlcNAc synthesis were assembled into FMMs, and the GlcNAc titer in flask was increased to 8.30&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.57&nbsp;g/L, which was almost three times that of the control strains. Notably, FMM component modification can maintain the OD600 in stationary phase and reduce cell lysis in the later stage of fermentation. These results reveal that the improved plasma membrane ordering achieved by the engineering FMM components could not only promote the enzyme assembly into FMMs, but also improve the cell fitness.",

				"abstractText": "BackgroundXylose is the most prevalent sugar available in hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) and of great interest for the green economy. Unfortunately, most of the cell factories cannot inherently metabolize xylose as sole carbon source. Yarrowia lipolytica is a non-conventional yeast that produces industrially important metabolites. The yeast is able to metabolize a large variety of substrates including both hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon sources. However, Y. lipolytica lacks effective metabolic pathway for xylose uptake and only scarce information is available on utilization of xylose. For the economica feasibility of LCB-based biorefineries, effective utilization of both pentose and hexose sugars is obligatory.ResultsIn the present study, succinic acid (SA) production from xylose by Y. lipolytica was examined. To this end, Y. lipolytica PSA02004 strain was engineered by overexpressing pentose pathway cassette comprising xylose reductase (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and xylulose kinase (XK) gene. The recombinant strain exhibited a robust growth on xylose as sole carbon source and produced substantial amount of SA. The inhibition of cell growth and SA formation was observed above 60 g/L xylose concentration. The batch cultivation of the recombinant strain in a bioreactor resulted in a maximum biomass concentration of 7.3 g/L and SA titer of 11.2 g/L with the yield of 0.19 g/g. Similar results in terms of cell growth and SA production were obtained with xylose-rich hydrolysate derived from sugarcane bagasse. The fed-batch fermentation yielded biomass concentration of 11.8 g/L (OD600: 56.1) and SA titer of 22.3 g/L with a gradual decrease in pH below 4.0. Acetic acid was obtained as a main by-product in all the fermentations.ConclusionThe recombinant strain displayed potential for bioconversion of xylose to SA. Further, this study provided a new insight on conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added products. To the best of o",

				"abstractText": "The anchoring of metabolic pathway enzymes to spatial scaffolds can significantly improve their reaction efficiency. Here, we successfully constructed a multi-enzyme complex assembly system able to enhance bioproduction in bacteria by using the endogenous spatial scaffolds─functional membrane microdomains (FMMs). First, using VA-TIRFM and SPT analysis, we reveal that FMMs possess high temporal and spatial stability at the plasma membrane and can be used as endogenous spatial scaffolds to organize enzyme pathways. Then, taking the synthesis of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in Bacillus subtilis as a proof-of-concept demonstration, we found that anchoring of various enzymes required for GlcNAc synthesis onto FMMs to obtain the FMMs-multi-enzyme complex system resulted in a significant increase in GlcNAc titer and an effectively alleviate in cell lysis at the later stage of fermentation compared to that in control strains expressing the related enzymes in the cytoplasm. Combining with metabolic model and kinetics analysis, the existence of a constructed substrate channel that maximizes the reaction efficiency is verified. In summary, we propose a novel metabolic pathway assembly model which allowed improved titers and compartmentalized flux control with high spatial resolution in bacterial metabolism.",

				"abstractText": "Clostridium cellulovorans DSM 743B can produce butyrate when grown on lignocellulose, but it can hardly synthesize butanol. In a previous study, C. cellulovorans was successfully engineered to switch the metabolism from butyryl-CoA to butanol by overexpressing an alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase gene adhE1 from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824; however, its full potential in butanol production is still unexplored. In the study, a metabolic engineering approach based on a push-pull strategy was developed to further enhance cellulosic butanol production. In order to accomplish this, the carbon flux from acetyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA was pulled by overexpressing a trans-enoyl-coenzyme A reductase gene (ter), which can irreversibly catalyze crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. Then an acid reassimilation pathway uncoupled with acetone production was introduced to redirect the carbon flow from butyrate and acetate toward butyryl-CoA. Finally, xylose metabolism engineering was implemented by inactivating xylR (Clocel_0594) and araR (Clocel_1253), as well as overexpressing xylT (CA_C1345), which is expected to supply additional carbon and reducing power for CoA and butanol synthesis pathways. The final engineered strain produced 4.96 g/L of n-butanol from alkali extracted corn cobs (AECC), increasing by 235-fold compared to that of the wild type. It serves as a promising butanol producer by consolidated bioprocessing.",

				"abstractText": "Dynamic regulation is an effective strategy for fine-tuning metabolic pathways in order to maximize target product synthesis. However, achieving dynamic and autonomous up- and down-regulation of the metabolic modules of interest simultaneously, still remains a great challenge. In this work, we created an autonomous dual-control (ADC) system, by combining CRISPRi-based NOT gates with novel biosensors of a key metabolite in the pathway of interest. By sensing the levels of the intermediate glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and self-adjusting the expression levels of the target genes accordingly with the GlcN6P biosensor and ADC system enabled feedback circuits, the metabolic flux towards the production of the high value nutraceutical N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) could be balanced and optimized in Bacillus subtilis. As a result, the GlcNAc titer in a 15-l fed-batch bioreactor increased from 59.9 g/l to 97.1 g/l with acetoin production and 81.7 g/l to 131.6 g/l without acetoin production, indicating the robustness and stability of the synthetic circuits in a large bioreactor system. Remarkably, this self-regulatory methodology does not require any external level of control such as the use of inducer molecules or switching fermentation/environmental conditions. Moreover, the proposed programmable genetic circuits may be expanded to engineer other microbial cells and metabolic pathways.",

				"abstractText": "Microbial oils are regarded as promising alternatives to fossil fuels as concerns over environmental issues and energy production systems continue to mount. Odd-chain fatty acids (FAs) are a type of valuable lipid with various applications: they can serve as biomarkers, intermediates in the production of flavor and fragrance compounds, fuels, and plasticizers. Microorganisms naturally produce FAs, but such FAs are primarily even-chain; only negligible amounts of odd-chain FAs are generated. As a result, studies using microorganisms to produce odd-chain FAs have had limited success. Here, our objective was to biosynthesize odd-chain FAs de novo in Yarrowia lipolytica using inexpensive carbon sources, namely glucose, without any propionate supplementation. To achieve this goal, we constructed a modular metabolic pathway containing seven genes. In the engineered strain expressing this pathway, the percentage of odd-chain FAs out of total FAs was higher than in the control strain (3.86 vs. 0.84%). When this pathway was transferred into an obese strain, which had been engineered to accumulate large amounts of lipids, odd-chain fatty acid production was 7.2 times greater than in the control (0.05 vs. 0.36 g/L). This study shows that metabolic engineering research is making progress toward obtaining efficient cell factories that produce odd-chain FAs.",

But low DNA repair capacity and plasmids transformation efficiency severely delayed development and application of genetic tools based on homologous recombination (HR). TargeTron is a gene editing technique dependent on the mobility of group II introns, rather than homologous recombination, which made it very suitable for gene disruption of Clostridium. The application of TargeTron technology in Clostridium was academically reported in 2007 and this tool has been introduced in various clostridia as it is easy to operate, time-saving, and reliable. TargeTron has made great progress in solventogenic Clostridium in the aspects of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation pathway modification, important functional genes identification, and xylose metabolic pathway analysis &amp; reconstruction. In the review, we revisited 12 years' advances of TargeTron technology applicable in solventogenic Clostridium, including its principle, technical characteristics, application and efforts to expand its capabilities, or to avoid potential drawbacks. Some other technologies as putative competitors or collaborators are also discussed. We believe that TargeTron combined with CRISPR/Cas-assisted gene/base editing and gene-expression regulation system will make a better future for clostridial genetic modification.",

However, the existing aptamer-ligand biosensors can only function with non-complementary DNA elements that cannot replicate in growing cells. Here, we construct an aptamer-based synthetic regulatory circuit that can dynamically upregulate and downregulate the expression of target genes in response to the ligand thrombin at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively, and further used this system to dynamically engineer the synthesis of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) in Bacillus subtilis. First, we demonstrated the binding of ligand molecule thrombin with the aptamer can induce the unwinding of fully complementary double-stranded DNA. Based on this finding, we constructed a bifunctional gene expression regulatory circuit using ligand thrombin-bound aptamers. The expression of the reporter gene ranged from 0.084- to 48.1-fold. Finally, by using the bifunctional regulatory circuit, we dynamically upregulated the expression of key genes fkp and futC and downregulated the expression of gene purR, resulting in the significant increase of 2'-FL titer from 24.7 to 674 mg/L. Compared with the other pathway-specific dynamic engineering systems, here the constructed aptamer-based regulatory circuit is independent of pathways, and can be generally used to fine-tune gene expression in other microbes.",

				"abstractText": "Background: Oleaginous yeasts are potent hosts for the renewable production of lipids and harbor great potential for derived products, such as biofuels. Several promising processes have been described that produce hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels based on fatty acid decarboxylation and fatty aldehyde decarbonylation. Unfortunately, besides fatty aldehyde toxicity and high reactivity, the most investigated enzyme, aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase, shows unfavorable catalytic properties which hindered high yields in previous metabolic engineering approaches. Results: To demonstrate an alternative alkane production pathway for oleaginous yeasts, we describe the production of diesel-like, odd-chain alkanes and alkenes, by heterologously expressing a recently discovered light-driven oxidase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) in Yarrowia lipolytica. Initial experiments showed that only strains engineered to have an increased pool of free fatty acids were susceptible to sufficient decarboxylation. Providing these strains with glucose and light in a synthetic medium resulted in titers of 10.9&nbsp;mg/L of hydrocarbons. Using custom 3D printed labware for lighting bioreactors, and an automated pulsed glycerol fed-batch strategy, intracellular titers of 58.7&nbsp;mg/L were achieved. The production of odd-numbered alkanes and alkenes with a length of 17 and 15 carbons shown in previous studies could be confirmed. Conclusions: Oleaginous yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica can transform renewable resources such as glycerol into fatty acids and lipids. By heterologously expressing a fatty acid photodecarboxylase from the algae Chlorella variabilis hydrocarbons were produced in several scales from microwell plate to 400&nbsp;mL bioreactors. The lighting turned out to be a crucial factor in terms of growth and hydrocarbon production, therefore, the evaluation of different conditions was an important step towards a tailor-made process. In general, the developed bioprocess shows a route t",

				"abstractText": "Quorum sensing (QS)-based dynamic regulation has been widely used as basic tool for fine-tuning gene expression in response to cell density changes without adding expensive inducers. However, most reported QS systems primarily relied on down-regulation rather than up-regulation of gene expression, significantly limiting its potential as a molecular switch to control metabolic flux. To solve this challenge, we developed a bifunctional and modular Phr60-Rap60-Spo0A QS system, based on two native promoters, P abrB (down-regulation by Spo0A-P) and P spoiiA (up-regulation by Spo0A-P). We constructed a library of promoters with different capacities to implement down-regulation and up-regulation by changing the location, number, and sequences of the binding sites for Spo0A-P. The QS system can dynamically balance the relationship between efficient synthesis of the target product and cell growth. Finally, we validated the usefulness of this strategy by dynamic control of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) synthesis in Bacillus subtilis 168, a model Gram-positive bacterium, with the bifunctional Phr60-Rap60-Spo0A quorum sensing system. Our dynamic pathway regulation led to a 40-fold improvement of MK-7 production from 9 to 360 mg/L in shake flasks and 200 mg/L in 15-L bioreactor. Taken together, our bilayer QS system has been successfully integrated with biocatalytic functions to achieve dynamic pathway regulation in B.&nbsp;subtilis 168, which may be extended for use in other microbes to fine-tune gene expression and improve metabolites production.",

Synthetic biology approaches offer the ability to genetically engineer these communities to improve the properties of these fermented foods. Soy sauce is a fermented condiment with a vast global market. Engineering members of the microbial communities responsible for soy sauce fermentation may therefore lead to the development of improved products. One important property is the colour of soy sauce, with recent evidence pointing to a consumer preference for more lightly-coloured soy sauce products for particular dishes.ResultsHere we show that a bacterial member of the natural soy sauce fermentation microbial community, Bacillus, can be engineered to reduce the &lsquo;browning&rsquo; reaction during soy sauce production. We show that two approaches result in &lsquo;de-browning&rsquo;: engineered consumption of xylose, an important precursor in the browning reaction, and engineered degradation of melanoidins, the major brown pigments in soy sauce. Lastly, we show that these two strategies work synergistically using co-cultures to result in enhanced de-browning.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the potential of using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering methods for fine-tuning the process of soy sauce fermentation and indeed for many other natural food and beverage fermentations for improved products.",

However, its n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has yet to be demonstrated. This study demonstrates the construction of a CoA-dependent acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) pathway in C. cellulovorans by introducing genes of adhE1 and ctfA-ctfB-adc from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, which enabled it to produce n-butanol using the abundant and low-cost agricultural waste of alkali-extracted, deshelled corn cobs (AECC) as sole carbon source. Then, a novel adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach was adapted to strengthen the n-butanol tolerance of C. cellulovorans, to fully utilize its n-butanol output potential. To further improve n-butanol production, both metabolic engineering and evolutionary engineering were combined, using the evolved strain as host for metabolic engineering. The n-butanol production from AECC of the engineered C. cellulovorans enhanced 138-fold from less than 0.025 g/L to 3.47 g/L. This method represents a milestone toward n-butanol production by CBP, using single recombinant clostridia.

To this end, we constructed two alternative expression cassettes composed of previously identified genes, putatively involved in the Ehrlich pathway in Y. lipolytica, and cloned them under the control of constitutive pTEF promoter, and by this-released them from extensive native regulation. The effects of the pathway engineering were investigated upon provision of different, Ehrlich pathway-inducing amino acids (L-Phe, L-Leu, L-Ile and L-Val). In general, amplification of the Ehrlich pathway in many cases led to increased formation of a respective higher alcohol from its precursor. We observed interesting effects of aminotransferase BAT2 deletion on synthesis of 2-phenylethanol and its acetate ester, significant relationship between L-Val and L-Phe catabolic pathways, and extensive 'cross-induction' of the derivative compounds synthesis by non-direct precursors.",

				"abstractText": "One of the primary goals of microbial metabolic engineering is to achieve high titer, yield and productivity (TYP) of engineered strains. This TYP index requires optimized carbon flux toward desired molecule with minimal by-product formation. De novo redesign of central carbon and redox metabolism holds great promise to alleviate pathway bottleneck and improve carbon and energy utilization efficiency. The engineered strain, with the overexpression or deletion of multiple genes, typically can&rsquo;t meet the TYP index, due to overflow of central carbon and redox metabolism that compromise the final yield, despite a high titer or productivity might be achieved. To solve this challenge, we reprogramed the central carbon and redox metabolism of Bacillus subtilis and achieved high TYP production of N-acetylglucosamine. Specifically, a &ldquo;push&ndash;pull&ndash;promote&rdquo; approach efficiently reduced the overflown acetyl-CoA flux and eliminated byproduct formation. Four synthetic NAD(P)-independent metabolic routes were introduced to rewire the redox metabolism to minimize energy loss. Implementation of these genetic strategies led us to obtain a B. subtilis strain with superior TYP index. GlcNAc titer in shake flask was increased from 6.6 g L&minus;1 to 24.5 g L&minus;1, the yield was improved from 0.115 to 0.468 g GlcNAc g&minus;1 glucose, and the productivity was increased from 0.274 to 0.437 g L&minus;1 h&minus;1. These titer and yield are the highest levels ever reported and, the yield reached 98% of the theoretical pathway yield (0.478 g g&minus;1 glucose).

Here, we synergistically engineered the carbon metabolism and redox metabolism in the cytosol and mitochondria of a previously engineered Aspergillus oryzae to further improve the l-malate titer and decrease the byproduct succinate concentration. First, the accumulation of the intermediate pyruvate was eliminated by overexpressing a pyruvate carboxylase from Rhizopus oryzae in the cytosol and mitochondria of A.&nbsp;oryzae, and consequently, the l-malate titer increased 7.5%.

Next, the exchange of byproducts (succinate and fumarate) between the cytosol and mitochondria was regulated by the expression of a dicarboxylate carrier Sfc1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the mitochondria, which increased l-malate titer 3.5% and decreased succinate concentration 36.8%.

N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is a typical nutraceutical and has many applications in the field of healthcare. Here, we have developed a gene repressor system based on xylose-induced CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in Bacillus subtilis, aimed at downregulating the expression of three genes (zwf, pfkA, glmM) that control the major competing reactions of GlcNAc synthesis (pentose phosphate pathway (HMP), glycolysis, and peptidoglycan synthesis pathway (PSP)), with the potential to relieve glucose repression and allow the co-utilization of both glucose and xylose. Simultaneous repression of these three genes by CRISPRi improved GlcNAc titer by 13.2% to 17.4 &plusmn; 0.47 g/L, with the GlcNAc yield on glucose and xylose showing an 84.1% improvement, reaching 0.42 &plusmn; 0.036 g/g. In order to further engineer the synergetic utilization of glucose and xylose, a combinatorial approach was developed based on 27 arrays containing sgRNAs with different repression capacities targeting the three genes. We further optimized the temporal control of the system and found that when 15 g/L xylose was added 6 h after inoculation, the most efficient strain, BNX122, synthesized 20.5 &plusmn; 0.85 g/L GlcNAc with a yield of 0.46 &plusmn; 0.010 g/g glucose and xylose in shake flask culture.

				"abstractText": "Background:Odd chain fatty acids (odd FAs) have a wide range of applications in therapeutic and nutritional industries, as well as in chemical industries including biofuel. Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast considered a preferred microorganism for the production of lipid-derived biofuels and chemicals. However, it naturally produces negligible amounts of odd chain fatty acids.Results:The possibility of producing odd FAs using Y. lipolytica was investigated. Y. lipolytica wild-type strain was shown able to grow on weak acids; acetate, lactate, and propionate. Maximal growth rate on propionate reached 0.24&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;0.01 h&minus;1 at 2 g/L, and growth inhibition occurred at concentration above 10 g/L. Wild-type strain accumulated lipids ranging from 7.39 to 8.14% (w/w DCW) depending on the carbon source composition, and odd FAs represented only 0.01&ndash;0.12 g/L. We here proved that the deletion of the PHD1 gene improved odd FAs production, which reached a ratio of 46.82% to total lipids. When this modification was transferred to an obese strain, engineered for improving lipid accumulation, further increase odd FAs production reaching a total of 0.57 g/L was shown. Finally, a fed-batch co-feeding strategy was optimized for further increase odd FAs production, which generated 0.75 g/L, the best production described so far in Y. lipolytica.Conclusions:A Y. lipolytica strain able to accumulate high level of odd chain fatty acids, mainly heptadecenoic acid, has been successfully developed. In addition, a fed-batch co-feeding strategy was optimized to further improve lipid accumulation and odd chain fatty acid content. These lipids enriched in odd chain fatty acid can (1) improve the properties of the biodiesel generated from Y. lipolytica lipids and (2) be used as renewable source of odd chain fatty acid for industrial applications. This work paves the way for further improvements in odd chain fatty acids and fatty acid-derived compound production.",

Here we report that in vivo combinatorial genomic rearrangement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast with a synthetic chromosome V can rapidly generate new, improved host strains with genetic backgrounds favourable to diverse heterologous pathways, including those for violacein and penicillin biosynthesis and for xylose utilisation. We show how the modular rearrangement of synthetic chromosomes by SCRaMbLE can be easily determined using long-read nanopore sequencing and we explore experimental conditions that optimise diversification and screening. This new synthetic genome approach to metabolic engineering provides productivity improvements in a fast, simple and accessible way, making it a valuable addition to existing strain improvement techniques.",

				"abstractText": "Background: Yarrowia lipolytica is a common biotechnological chassis for the production of lipids, which are the pre‑ferred feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals. To reduce the cost of microbial lipid production, inexpen‑sive carbon sources must be used, such as lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Unfortunately, lignocellulosic materials oftencontain toxic compounds and a large amount of xylose, which cannot be used by Y. lipolytica.Results: In this work, we engineered this yeast to efciently use xylose as a carbon source for the productionof lipids by overexpressing native genes. We further increased the lipid content by overexpressing heterologousgenes to facilitate the conversion of xylose-derived metabolites into lipid precursors. Finally, we showed that theseengineered strains were able to grow and produce lipids in a very high yield (lipid content = 67%, titer = 16.5 g/L,yield = 3.44 g/g sugars, productivity 1.85 g/L/h) on a xylose-rich agave bagasse hydrolysate in spite of toxiccompounds.Conclusions: This work demonstrates the potential of metabolic engineering to reduce the costs of lipid productionfrom inexpensive substrates as source of fuels and chemicals.",

				"abstractText": "Triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycogen are the two major metabolites for carbon storage in most eukaryotic organisms. We investigated the glycogen metabolism of the oleaginous Y. lipolytica and found that this yeast accumulates up to 16% glycogen in its biomass. Assuming that elimination of glycogen synthesis would result in an improvement of lipid accumulation, we characterized and deleted the single gene coding for glycogen synthase, YlGSY1. The mutant was grown under lipogenic conditions with glucose and glycerol as substrates and we obtained up to 60% improvement in TAG accumulation compared to the wild type strain. Additionally, YlGSY1 was deleted in a background that was already engineered for high lipid accumulation. In this obese background, TAG accumulation was also further increased. The highest lipid content of 52% was found after 3 days of cultivation in nitrogen-limited glycerol medium. Furthermore, we constructed mutants of Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae that are deleted for both glycogen and TAG synthesis, demonstrating that the ability to store carbon is not essential. Overall, this work showed that glycogen synthesis is a competing pathway for TAG accumulation in oleaginous yeasts and that deletion of the glycogen synthase has beneficial effects on neutral lipid storage.",

Here, we engineered Y. lipolytica to metabolize xylose to produce lipids or citric acid. The overexpression of xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from Scheffersomyces stipitis were necessary but not sufficient to permit growth. The additional overexpression of the endogenous xylulokinase enabled identical growth as the wild type strain in glucose. This mutant was able to produce up to 80 g/L of citric acid from xylose.
